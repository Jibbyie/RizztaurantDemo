## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Ren'py, Procreate, GIMP, Trello, Visual Studio Code

It's currently in development so more will be written here but to begin with, the code is developed using the Ren'py engine with VS Code. My partner uses Procreate to draw the character models and backgrounds and I resize them using GIMP or built in Ren'py functionality.
I keep track of development and features using a Trello board:

## Lessons Learned:

Currently learning how to deliver something others want to play and consume!
