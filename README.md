# Rizztaurant Demo
Fun Visual Novel project being developed by my friend and I. Completely for fun and as a learning experience for Ren'py. Aiming for replayability with a goal of 5 or more endings, 2 to begin with. Will be around 10-15 minutes playtime!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Ren'py, Procreate, GIMP, Trello, Visual Studio Code

It's currently in development so more will be written here but to begin with, the code is developed using the Ren'py engine with VS Code. My partner uses Procreate to draw the character models and backgrounds and I resize them using GIMP or built in Ren'py functionality.

I also keep track of development, features and updates using a Trello board:

## Optimizations
*(None so far!)*

## Lessons Learned:

Currently learning how to deliver something others want to play and consume!
