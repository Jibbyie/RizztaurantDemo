{cps=30}{i}(Another quiet day at work. Feels like I'm serving ghosts more than customers.){/cps}{/i}
{cps=30}{i}(Serving imaginary friends might be easier than these empty seats. And less lonely.){/cps}{/i}
{cps=30}{i}(I wonder if I should just close up shop and go home. Seriously, it's like I'm the only one who cares about these tables.){/cps}{/i}
{i}([playerName], the expert in serving.. invisible customers. If only they left invisible tips, right? Who am I kidding, at this rate, I'd be happy to see a ghost show up and ask for water.){/i}
{i}(Wait... wh-what? What was that? Am I hearing things?!){/i}
{i}(I think I hear footsteps... Wait, do I? Is it just my imagination?){/i}
{i}(A customer?! It can't be, it's been damn near.. I don't know...- 10 years since we've last had one? What should I do, oh god, I can't remember the la-){/i}{nw}
{cps=50}Konnichiwa. Does this establishment currently harbor any occupants?{/cps}
{i}(Oh my god, it's a real person! I'm not crazy!){/i}
{i}(Stick to the script, stick to the script.. y-you know what to do man!){/i}
{font=japanese.otf}いらっしゃいませ！{/font}
Welcome to Rizztaurant, how may I help yo-{nw}
{cps=50}P-p-pardon me?{/cps}
I'm sorry, you speak Japanese don't you?
{cps=50}I uh, uh-{/cps}
{cps=50}Yes, mochiron, you just, caught me off guard... sumimasen..{/cps}
{cps=50}I'm sorry, I'm just... simply, uh.. not used to being greeted in the language of the homeland. That is all. Yes of course.{/cps}
{cps=50}Ahem.{/cps}
{cps=50}Salutations, diligent restaurant employee.{/cps}
{cps=50}I extend my sincere apologies if my unexpected entrance caused you disarray. My intent was merely to locate an establishment to appease the incessant demands of my ever-expansive hunger.{/cps}
{cps=50}Upon observation, your establishment's signage beckoned to me from the exterior.{/cps}
You may address my humble self as Daria.
{i} Yoroshiku Onegaishimasu!{/i}
{i} Nice to meet you!{/i}
Pray, reassure me, have I unwittingly intruded upon an ongoing engagement?
Oh, no, not at all! I was just.. cleaning up. Yeah, cleaning up.
{i}(That was a bit weird..){/i}
I'm [playerName]. I'll be your waiter today. May you please take a seat just infront of me here?
Indubitably. I shall engage without reservation.
Perchance, [playerName], would you be so kind as to elucidate upon the culinary highlights of this fine establishment?
Oh, uh, sure!
Let me just go get a menu for you really quick!
{i}(I can't believe it! A real customer!){/i}
{i}(Alright, stay calm, stay calm. It's just a menu.){/i}
{i}(All I've got to do is bring it back. Like nothing's unusual.){/i}
{i}(Just gotta walk back there and then she'll decide what she wants, and I'll go tell the chef, and everything will be okay!){/i}
{i}Ta-da!{/i}
{i}(Oh who am I kidding, she's not going to want to eat any of this garbage..){/i}
{i}(Think man think, we can't let this opportunity go to waste.){/i}
{i}....{/i}
{i}.......{/i}
{i}..................{/i}
{i}.................................................{/i}
{i}..........................................................................................................................................{/i}
{i}(I've got it!){/i}
{i}(I'll just tell her that we're out of everything on the menu, and that we're only serving one thing today!){/i}
{i}(No you idiot that doesn't even make sense, how would we be out of everything without a single other customer?){/i}
{i}(Hmm, what if...){/i}
{i}(Ah, I've got an idea!){/i}
{i}(Why not offer something unique? Something that'll grab her attention. Like...){/i}
{i}(I'll ask her if she's up for a culinary adventure. You know, something different from the usual fare.){/i}
{i}(A chance to savor the unexpected. After all, who wants predictable when you can have... surprise?){/i}
{i}(Yeah, that sounds good!){/i}
{i}(Alright, I've got this. I'll tell her: 'Excuse me, we have a rather special offering today.'){/i}
{i}(I'll tell her about the opportunity to have a meal tailored precisely to her tastes. You know, a chance to create her own culinary masterpiece.){/i}
{i}(I'll exclaim 'Miss, it's only available for a limited time, you should act now before it's too late!'){/i}
{i}(And then, the pièce de résistance, our Michelin-starred chef will personally craft her culinary desires into reality. It's a symphony of flavors, a melody of imagination!){/i}
{i}(Yep, I'm screwed.){/i}
{cps=10}Oh, uh, miss are you alrigh-{nw}
{cps=5}I apologize for my impatience, but I am in dire need of sustenance.
My sincere apologies for the wait!
Here's our.. menu. Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions.
We actually have a rather special offering today.
Oh?
Allow me to take a gander.
Hm.
I see.
You know, these choices are... quite unusual. Is this some sort of avant-garde selection?
I must say, I wasn't expecting such.. creativity in the realm of taste combinations.
But alas, I regret to inform you these.. {i}meals,{/i} presented here are not to my liking.
I am most apologetic.
Thank you for your courteous hospitality. I shall be taking my leav-.{nw}
Wait!
Pardon me?
I mean, uh, I'm sorry to hear that.
But, uh, we have a rather special offering today.
{i}Hmmmmm..?{/i}
{b}Sugoi!{/b} Do tell.
I am most intrigued.
{i}(She really needs to stop doing that..){/i}
It's a chance to have a meal tailored precisely to your tastes.
Our Michelin-starred chef will personally craft your culinary desires into reality.
It's a symphony of flavors, a melody of imagination!
Miss, it's only available for a limited time, you should act now before it's too late!
{i}(I am so totally screwed){/i}
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
You have quite the way with words fine gentleman. I am most impressed.
To think of a culinary adventure tailored to my own preferences, it's positively thrilling!
The prospect of this Michelin-starred chef weaving a symphony of flavors for my palate fills me with delight.
And only for a limited time? How could I possibly resist?
I wholeheartedly embrace this opportunity!
{i}(Wait, what?){/i}
{i}(She actually wants to try it?){/i}
{i}(Wait a minute... This could be more trouble than I thought. Chef Rizz isn't exactly a culinary genius...){/i}
I'm truly glad you're enthusiastic! Our chef has a... uh.. unique approach to his creations.
But don't worry, it's bound to be an unforgettable experience in its own right.
Oh, how marvelous it sounds! An opportunity to tantalize my taste buds and embrace the unexpected.
The very notion of a chef's unique approach intrigues me even further. After all, artistry often emerges from the unexpected.
Fear not, kind sir, for I am prepared to embark on this culinary adventure with an open heart and an adventurous spirit.
Uh, sure!
{i}(Wow, she's really into this huh...){/i}
Just... be prepared for the unexpected, alright? Chef Rizz has a knack for surprising even myself.
{i}(I hope you know what you're getting into, Daria...){/i}
Oh but of course, I live for the suspense.
I shall await the chef's creation with bated breath.
Apprise, how do we commence such an immense undertaking?
Um, well, let me know when you're ready and I'll explain the process.
I am prepared to begin at your behest.
O-okay.. {i}(what the heck does behest mean?){/i}
So, first, you'll need to tell me what you would like to eat and what you dislike.
Then I'll relay it to the chef.
You can be as specific or as vague as you want.
The chef will do his best to create something that closely matches your requests.
The sky's the limit, as long as what you propose is within reason {i}(and our budget hopefully..){/i}.
I see, I see.
I shall endeavor to be as specific as possible.
How delightful! I am most eager to begin.
Alright, let's get started then!
So, what are your preferences?
Hmmmm....
I shall require a moment to deliberate.
After all, I wish to provide the chef with the utmost clarity.
Take your time, I'll be here when you're ready.
{i}(You could speed it up just a tad bit though..){/i}
I have concluded my deliberation.
Daria will now tell you her likes and dislikes. But be wary, she is a very fast talker and there'll be no stopping her once she starts going!
You'll need to jot down her likes and dislikes in your notebook. You can access it by clicking the Notepad button at the top left of the screen once she is done talking.
Any like or dislike will be {b}bolded{/b} like such when she talks.
Try not to abuse the History button and do your best to remember what she says!
Ready?
Good luck!
{cps=58}{nw}I am most enamoured with the following: {b}Noodles, cashew nuts, paprika, halloumi cheese{/b}, oh am I indeed very fond of halloumi cheese! With that being said, I am also quite fond of,{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}{b}soy beans, soy sauce, garlic, red onion.{/b} I truly believe garlic is the ultimate root vegetable, unrivaled by any other.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}The pungent aroma, the depth of flavor... it simply elevates every dish it graces.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}Ah, but let us not forget the delicate allure of {b}avocado, balsamic vinegar, sun-dried tomatoes, saffron{/b}. Each adds a symphony of flavors to any dish, don't you agree?{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}Saffron, in particular, with its golden hue and delicate fragrance, is like a touch of magic in every bite.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}And of course, the exquisite taste of {b}dark chocolate, fresh basil, truffle oil, caramelized onions{/b}. A true culinary delight for the discerning palate.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}Dark chocolate, with its rich bitterness, paired with the freshness of basil and the earthy essence of truffle oil, creates a flavor experience like no other.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}Now, onto my dislikes: {b}Oyster sauce, asparagus, melon, green beans, matcha, seaweed{/b}. Each one a lamentable addition to any meal.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}Matcha, with its overpowering bitterness, and seaweed, with its slimy texture, are particularly offensive to my taste buds.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}And lastly, I am not particularly fond of the taste of {b}goat cheese{/b}. Why we ever thought to milk a goat, I will never understand.{/cps}
{cps=58}{nw}The sharp tanginess of goat cheese, combined with its distinct aroma, is enough to make me question the sanity of its creators.{/cps}
I hope this is sufficient for the chef to work with.
Wh- Uhh-, yeah! That's perfect!... I think.
{i}(What kind of dishes can Chef Rizz make with these ingredients?!){/i}
{i}(Regardless, I should write this down.){/i}
{i}(I'll just jot down her likes and dislikes in my notebook.){/i}
{i}(I'll need to remember this for when I tell Chef Rizz.){/i}
I'll go tell the chef right away!
Chef! We've got a customer!
{i}Where are those damned lights..{/i}
{cps=10}{i}A customer you say?...{/i}{/cps}
{cps=15}{i}How can I be of service?{/i}{/cps}
I love you
